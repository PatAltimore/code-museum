    content: "The `T_MovePlane` function is responsible for moving floors and ceilings within a sector, either up or down, while checking for potential collisions or crushing effects. This routine is central to DOOM's dynamic environment, allowing for interactive elements like elevators, crushing ceilings, and rising platforms. At the time, DOOM's developers were pushing the limits of what was possible on consumer-grade hardware, relying on clever algorithms to simulate 3D environments efficiently. The function's design reflects the constraints of the era, such as limited memory and processing power, which necessitated careful optimization. By abstracting floor and ceiling movement into a single function, the developers ensured consistency and reusability across the game's levels. This approach influenced later game engines, such as the Build engine used in Duke Nukem 3D, which also featured dynamic level elements. The concept of interactive environments has since become a staple in modern gaming, appearing in engines like Unreal Engine and Unity."

    content: "The `T_MoveFloor` function orchestrates the movement of floors to their destination heights, either raising or lowering them. It interacts with `T_MovePlane` to execute the movement and plays sound effects to enhance the player's experience. This function also handles special cases, such as changing textures or sector properties when the floor reaches its destination. In the early 1990s, such dynamic level interactions were groundbreaking, contributing to DOOM's immersive gameplay. The ability to alter the environment in real-time added depth to level design, allowing for puzzles, traps, and other gameplay elements. This technique inspired similar mechanics in later games, such as Half-Life's scripted sequences and Portal's dynamic environments. The use of sound effects to signal floor movement also set a precedent for audio feedback in games, a feature now ubiquitous in modern titles."

    title: "Implementing diverse floor movement types"
    wikipedia_url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOOM_engine"
    image_url: ""
    image_caption: ""
    content: "The `EV_DoFloor` function handles various types of floor movements, such as lowering to the lowest surrounding floor, raising to the nearest ceiling, or turbo-lowering for faster movement. It dynamically allocates memory for floor movement objects and assigns them to sectors, ensuring smooth transitions and interactions. This function exemplifies DOOM's modular approach to level mechanics, where different movement types could be combined to create unique gameplay scenarios. In 1993, this level of flexibility was rare in games, as most titles relied on static environments. The modular design allowed DOOM's levels to feel alive and responsive, setting a new standard for interactivity in gaming. Later engines, such as Quake's, expanded on this concept, introducing even more dynamic elements like rotating platforms and destructible environments. The ability to script diverse floor behaviors also influenced level editors, enabling creators to design intricate and engaging levels."

    title: "Building staircases dynamically"

    image_caption: ""
    content: "The `EV_BuildStairs` function constructs staircases dynamically by raising adjacent sectors incrementally. It calculates the height and speed of each step, ensuring a smooth transition between sectors. This mechanic allowed DOOM's levels to feature complex verticality, enhancing exploration and gameplay variety. In the early 1990s, dynamic staircase building was a novel concept, as most games relied on pre-designed, static environments. The ability to create stairs programmatically added flexibility to level design, enabling designers to craft intricate layouts without manual adjustments. This technique influenced later games, such as Unreal Tournament, which featured dynamic level elements like elevators and ramps. The concept of procedural level adjustments also paved the way for modern procedural generation techniques, seen in games like Minecraft and No Man's Sky. By introducing dynamic stair-building, DOOM demonstrated how simple algorithms could create profound gameplay effects."
