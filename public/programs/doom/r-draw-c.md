    image_caption: ""
    content: "This range contains the active `R_DrawColumn` function and, guarded by an #ifdef USEASM block that was never enabled in the release build, a manually unrolled variant that was explored and ultimately discarded. The shipping version walks down each vertical wall slice one pixel at a time, computing framebuffer addresses with prebuilt ylookup and columnofs tables so that every iteration reduces to a single table lookup and an indexed write instead of a multiply-add. On a 486 processor, eliminating the multiply was a meaningful win given that R_DrawColumn was one of the most-called functions in the entire engine. The shelved unrolled version processed multiple pixels per iteration to amortize loop-control overhead, a valid strategy but one that bloated the instruction cache footprint and yielded diminishing returns on the in-order integer pipelines of the era. Leaving the dead code in the source is itself historically instructive: it documents that Carmack explored the technique, measured it, and chose the simpler loop. This kind of iterative, evidence-driven optimization became a defining characteristic of id Software's engineering culture and influenced how later engine teams approached renderer micro-optimization."

    content: "The `R_DrawColumnLow` function handles rendering in DOOM's 'blocky mode,' a low-resolution setting designed to improve performance on slower systems. By doubling pixel width and height, the game reduces the computational load, allowing it to run on hardware that might otherwise struggle. This mode was a practical solution for players with older PCs, ensuring DOOM's accessibility to a broader audience. The trade-off was a noticeable reduction in visual fidelity, but the gameplay experience remained intact. This approach reflects the era's emphasis on scalability, a principle that continues to influence game development today."

    image_caption: ""
    content: "The `R_DrawFuzzColumn` function implements DOOM's 'fuzzy' rendering effect, used to create the illusion of invisibility for Spectres and invisible players. By offsetting pixels horizontally and applying a specific colormap, the function creates a distorted, ghostly appearance. This technique was a clever workaround for the lack of advanced transparency effects on 1990s hardware. Spectres became one of DOOM's most iconic enemies, and the fuzzy rendering effect was widely praised for its eerie realism. The concept of manipulating pixels to simulate transparency influenced later games, including Quake and Unreal, which built upon these ideas with more advanced graphics hardware."

    content: "The `R_DrawTranslatedColumn` function uses translation tables to remap color ramps, enabling player customization and enemy variations. For example, the green color ramp of player sprites could be mapped to gray, red, or other colors, allowing multiple players to be visually distinct in multiplayer mode. This feature also allowed enemies like the Hell Knight to share sprites with the Baron of Hell, saving memory while maintaining visual diversity. The use of translation tables was an ingenious solution to the constraints of 1990s hardware, where memory was limited and every byte mattered. This technique influenced later games that sought to optimize resource usage while offering customization options."

This functionality was essential for multiplayer customization and enemy differentiation. By assuming a specific structure of the PLAYPAL lump, the function avoids the need for additional data files, keeping DOOM's resource footprint small. This approach reflects id Software's focus on efficiency and adaptability, ensuring the game could run on a wide range of systems. Translation tables became a standard technique in game development, influencing sprite-based games and even modern engines that use palette-based rendering."

    content: "The `R_DrawSpan` function handles rendering horizontal spans for floors and ceilings. Unlike walls, which are rendered as vertical columns, floors and ceilings require traversal in both texture space u and v. This function uses a simple yet effective algorithm to step through the texture at an angle, ensuring consistent z-depth. In the early 1990s, perspective-correct texture mapping was computationally expensive, so DOOM's approach prioritized speed over accuracy. This decision allowed the game to maintain high frame rates while delivering visually impressive environments. The technique influenced later engines, which refined span rendering for more complex 3D worlds."

This feature was crucial for supporting different resolutions and aspect ratios, ensuring DOOM could run on a wide range of hardware configurations. The function uses predefined patches to create beveled edges and decorative patterns, enhancing the game's visual appeal. This attention to detail reflects id Software's commitment to delivering a polished experience, even on lower-end systems.

By erasing sections of the screen and marking regions for updates, the function ensures a seamless transition between gameplay and UI elements. This approach was particularly important for players using smaller viewports, as it maintained visual consistency while optimizing performance. The function exemplifies id Software's focus on scalability, a principle that influenced later engines and games aiming to support diverse hardware setups. The concept of view borders remains relevant in modern UI design, where adaptive layouts are essential for cross-platform compatibility."
