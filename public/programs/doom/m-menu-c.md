    image_caption: ""
    content: "This block defines a set of strings for gamma correction messages, which inform players of the brightness level they are adjusting to. Gamma correction was critical for DOOM because monitors of the early 1990s varied widely in brightness and color fidelity. By providing five discrete levels, DOOM ensured players could tailor the visual experience to their hardware. John Carmack, known for his technical precision, likely implemented this feature to address complaints about visibility in darker levels. Gamma adjustment became a standard feature in games, influencing titles like Quake and Unreal. Today, similar functionality exists in modern games under 'brightness' or 'HDR settings,' showing how DOOM anticipated user needs in an era of hardware variability."

    image_caption: ""
    content: "This section defines the `menuitem_t` struct, which encapsulates the properties of a single menu item, including its status, name, associated action routine, and hotkey. By using a struct, DOOM's developers made the menu system modular and extensible. This approach allowed easy addition or modification of menu items without rewriting large portions of code. In the early 1990s, modular programming was gaining traction as a way to manage complexity in increasingly sophisticated software. John Carmack's use of structs here reflects his focus on clean, maintainable code. The modular menu system influenced later games, including Quake and Half-Life, which adopted similar approaches for their user interfaces."

    image_caption: ""
    content: "This block defines both the MainMenu and EpisodeMenu tables using the menuitem_t and menu_t structs, establishing the game's top-level navigation as plain data rather than procedural code. MainMenu lists New Game, Options, Load Game, Save Game, Read This, and Quit DOOM, each bound to a handler function and a hotkey character, while EpisodeMenu provides entries for the four episodes with their M_EPIx graphic patches. By encoding the entire menu hierarchy as static initializer tables, id Software made it trivially easy to reconfigure menus for shareware, registered, and commercial editions at runtime in M_Init. The episodic structure was commercially significant: DOOM shipped in chapters that players could buy incrementally, a model that prefigured modern downloadable content. This data-driven approach to UI, where menu shape is described rather than scripted, became a common pattern in later game engines."
