    content: "This section defines the colors used in the automap, including walls, objects, and player indicators. These color constants were carefully chosen to ensure visibility on the low-resolution VGA displays common in 1993. By assigning specific ranges for each color, the automap could visually differentiate between elements like walls, secrets, and player positions. This design reflects the constraints of early PC graphics hardware, where palettes were limited and clarity was paramount. The automap's color scheme influenced later games, establishing conventions for map readability in first-person shooters and RPGs."

This minimalist approach ensured performance efficiency on hardware with limited processing power. The arrow's design also reflects the game's focus on clarity and usability, allowing players to quickly identify their position and orientation. The inclusion of a 'cheat' version of the arrow highlights DOOM's playful approach to game design, embedding secrets and cheats directly into the code.

It clears the frame buffer, draws grid lines, walls, players, objects, and marks, and finally updates the screen. This modular approach ensures that all elements of the automap are rendered efficiently and cohesively. The automap system in DOOM was a pioneering feature that influenced the design of navigation aids in countless games, from RPGs like Diablo to open-world titles like Skyrim."
