    content: "This section defines `INL_KeyService`, a routine that handles keyboard interrupts. It reads scan codes directly from the keyboard controller (port 0x60) and processes them to determine key states, ASCII values, and special key events like Caps Lock. The programmer, Jason Blochowiak, uses direct hardware interaction to bypass the BIOS, enabling faster and more flexible input handling. In 1992, this approach was critical for real-time games like Wolfenstein 3D, where responsiveness was paramount. The routine also includes logic for handling shifted and unshifted ASCII mappings and toggling Caps Lock behavior. This technique influenced how later games handled low-level input, particularly in the DOS era, where direct hardware access was often necessary for performance."

    content: "The `INL_GetMouseDelta` function retrieves mouse movement data using BIOS interrupt 0x33. By calling the interrupt with the `MDelta` command, it accesses the mouse driver and retrieves the movement deltas in the `_CX` and `_DX` registers. This direct interaction with the BIOS was a common technique in the early 1990s, as it provided a standardized way to access mouse input across different hardware configurations. The simplicity and efficiency of this approach allowed Wolfenstein 3D to maintain its fast-paced gameplay. Later game engines, including id Software's Doom engine, built on these techniques to handle mouse input in increasingly sophisticated ways."

    image_caption: ""
    content: "The `IN_GetJoyAbs` function reads the absolute position of a joystick using direct port access and assembly language. It interacts with port 0x201, which is tied to the joystick hardware, and uses precise timing loops to measure the resistance values of the joystick axes. This technique was necessary because joysticks of the era relied on analog signals that required careful calibration and timing to interpret correctly. The assembly code ensures that the process is uninterrupted by disabling interrupts (`CLI`) during the measurement. This approach highlights the ingenuity required to interface with hardware in the early 1990s, when standardized APIs for game controllers were not yet common. The method influenced joystick handling in later games and contributed to the development of more sophisticated input libraries."

    image_caption: ""
    content: "The `INL_StartKbd` function sets up a custom keyboard interrupt handler by replacing the BIOS interrupt vector for IRQ 1 (keyboard) with the game's own `INL_KeyService` routine. This allows Wolfenstein 3D to process keyboard input directly, bypassing the slower BIOS routines. By storing the original interrupt vector and restoring it later, the function ensures compatibility with other software. This technique was widely used in DOS games to achieve faster and more responsive input handling. It reflects the low-level programming skills required to optimize performance on early PC hardware. The approach influenced later game engines, which continued to use custom interrupt handlers for specialized input processing."

    content: "The `IN_SetupJoy` function calibrates joystick input by defining threshold values for the axes and calculating scaling factors. It divides the joystick's range into segments for precise motion detection and uses these thresholds to interpret input accurately. This calibration process was essential for ensuring consistent gameplay across different joystick models, which often had varying ranges and sensitivities. The function's design reflects id Software's commitment to providing a seamless user experience, even on hardware with limited standardization. The technique influenced joystick handling in later games and contributed to the development of input libraries that automated calibration processes."

    content: "The `IN_Startup` function initializes the input manager by detecting and configuring available input devices (keyboard, mouse, joystick). It checks command-line parameters to determine whether to enable specific devices and sets up interrupt handlers and device-specific routines. This modular approach allowed Wolfenstein 3D to support a wide range of hardware configurations, ensuring compatibility with the diverse PC market of the early 1990s. The function's design reflects the challenges of developing software for an ecosystem without standardized input APIs. It influenced later game engines, which adopted similar modular initialization processes to support multiple input devices seamlessly."

    content: "The `IN_ReadControl` function includes logic for recording and playing back input data for demo purposes. During demo recording, it packs control information (motion, button states) into a compact byte format and stores it in a buffer. During playback, it retrieves and interprets this data to simulate player actions. This feature allowed players to share their gameplay and developers to debug and showcase the game. The demo functionality was a precursor to modern replay systems, which have become a standard feature in competitive gaming and video sharing platforms. It also demonstrates id Software's forward-thinking approach to game design, prioritizing features that enhanced both player experience and developer productivity."

    image_caption: ""
    content: "The `IN_WaitForKey` and `IN_WaitForASCII` functions implement blocking waits for keyboard input, returning the scan code or ASCII value of the next key press. These routines are used in scenarios where the game needs to pause and wait for user interaction, such as menu navigation or acknowledgments. By directly accessing global variables updated by the keyboard interrupt handler, the functions achieve low-latency input detection. This approach highlights the importance of efficient input handling in real-time applications. The technique influenced later games, which continued to use similar blocking input routines for specific gameplay scenarios."
