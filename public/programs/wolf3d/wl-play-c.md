    image_url: ""
    image_caption: ""
    content: "This section implements input polling for keyboard, mouse, and joystick devices, ensuring seamless control across different hardware setups. The routines `PollKeyboardButtons`, `PollMouseButtons`, and `PollJoystickButtons` detect button states, while `PollKeyboardMove`, `PollMouseMove`, and `PollJoystickMove` calculate movement based on user input. At the time, MS-DOS games often struggled with inconsistent input handling due to varying device standards. John Carmack's approach unified these inputs into a single system, allowing Wolfenstein 3D to support a wide range of configurations without requiring extensive user setup. This design was influenced by Carmack's prior experience with Commander Keen, where similar challenges arose. The unified input system became a hallmark of id Software's engine design, influencing later titles like Doom and Quake, and setting a precedent for modular input handling in game engines."

    content: "The `CheckKeys` function includes several cheat codes and debugging keys, such as 'MLI' for full health and ammo, and 'TAB-G-F10' for toggling god mode. These codes were a nod to the developers' playful side and served as tools for testing the game during development. Cheat codes were a common feature in early PC games, providing players with hidden ways to explore and experiment. The inclusion of debug keys reflects id Software's iterative development process, where rapid testing and adjustment were crucial. These cheat systems became iconic, influencing games like Doom and Quake, and inspiring a generation of players to seek out hidden features in their favorite titles."

    content: "The functions `InitActorList`, `GetNewActor`, and `RemoveObj` manage the game's dynamic actor system using linked lists. This structure allows for efficient addition and removal of objects, ensuring smooth gameplay even as the number of actors changes. The use of linked lists reflects Carmack's mastery of low-level programming, optimizing memory usage and performance on limited hardware. This approach was critical for handling the game's fast-paced action, where actors like enemies and projectiles needed to be updated in real time. Dynamic actor management became a cornerstone of game engine design, influencing systems like Unreal Engine's object hierarchy and Unity's GameObject system."

    content: "The `StopMusic` function not only halts the game's music but also manages memory by unlocking and purging audio assets. This was essential for optimizing performance on MS-DOS systems with limited RAM. By freeing unused resources, id Software ensured that Wolfenstein 3D could maintain its fast-paced gameplay without running out of memory. This technique highlights the team's deep understanding of hardware constraints and their ability to innovate within them. Efficient memory management for audio became a standard practice in game development, influencing tools like FMOD and Wwise, which offer advanced resource handling for modern games."

    image_url: ""
    image_caption: ""
    content: "This function, `StartMusic`, handles the initialization and playback of background music in Wolfenstein 3D. It begins by turning off any currently playing music (`SD_MusicOff`) and then selects the appropriate music chunk based on the player's current map and episode. The function uses `CA_CacheAudioChunk` to load the music data into memory and locks it to prevent accidental overwrites. If no errors occur, the music is started using `SD_StartMusic`. In 1992, music playback on PCs often relied on hardware like the AdLib or Sound Blaster cards, which provided MIDI-like capabilities. The developers at id Software optimized their audio system to ensure smooth playback even on lower-end hardware. This approach influenced later games by demonstrating how to integrate immersive audio without compromising performance. Techniques like caching and locking audio data became standard practice in game development."

    content: "The `InitRedShifts` function creates dynamic palette shifts to simulate visual effects like damage or bonus flashes. It modifies the game's color palette by calculating intermediate color frames based on the original palette (`gamepal`). This technique, known as palette shifting, was widely used in the early 1990s to create visual effects without requiring additional graphics memory. By precomputing these shifts, id Software ensured that effects like damage flashes could be applied instantly during gameplay. At the time, hardware constraints made advanced graphics techniques impractical, so developers relied on clever tricks like this to enhance visual fidelity. Palette shifting became a hallmark of early PC games, influencing titles like Doom and Quake, which used similar techniques for lighting and effects."

    content: "`DoActor` is the core function responsible for updating the state of game objects, including enemies and interactive elements. It checks whether an actor is active and visible to the player, processes state transitions, and executes AI logic via function pointers (`think` and `action`). This modular approach allowed id Software to implement complex behaviors while keeping the codebase manageable. In 1992, game AI was often rudimentary, but Wolfenstein 3D's actor system laid the groundwork for more advanced simulations in later titles like Doom and Quake. The use of function pointers for AI logic became a common pattern in game development, enabling flexible and reusable designs."

    content: "`PlayLoop` is the main game loop that drives Wolfenstein 3D's real-time gameplay. It handles player input, updates game objects, processes palette shifts, and refreshes the 3D view. The loop also includes debugging aids, virtual reality helmet integration, and a humorous feature where BJ Blazkowicz makes a funny face if idle for too long. This function exemplifies the challenges of creating a smooth and responsive experience on early PCs. The inclusion of virtual reality support, albeit experimental, showcases id Software's forward-thinking approach. The game loop design influenced countless later titles, establishing patterns for real-time simulation and rendering that remain relevant in modern game engines."

objlist containt structures for every actor currently playing.  The structure
is accessed as a linked list starting at *player, ending when ob->next ==
NULL.  GetNewObj inserts a new object at the end of the list, meaning that
if an actor spawn another actor, the new one WILL get to think and react the
same frame.  RemoveObj unlinks the given object and returns it to the free
list, but does not damage the objects ->next pointer, so if the current object
removes itself, a linked list following loop can still safely get to the
next element.
