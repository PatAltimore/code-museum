    content: "The parser's header names Marc Blank and the date 28 July 1983, the same as in Zork II, because this is the same file. The file comments mention two retrofixes, WHICH and TRAP. The game came out in 1982, and the generic parser contains comments dated 1984, so this is a later rebuild of the parser than the game's first release. The older parser.zil in this repository shows what it looked like before. Parser globals begin with P- by convention, since ZIL has no namespaces."

    content: "The parse result is a ten-word table: the verb, up to two prepositions and up to two noun clauses, each as a pointer into the input. Zork III's longest commands fit it exactly. 'put the book in the slot', 'turn the dial to 5', 'tie the rope to the chest' and 'give the waybread to the old man' all have a verb, a direct object, a preposition and an indirect object, the full shape the table can store. Anything more elaborate has nowhere to go, which is why the game's grammar stays so small. The same table is saved as P-OTBL when the game orphans a command."

    content: "OOPS replaces the unknown word of the last command and AGAIN, or G, repeats it. Both matter in Zork III because many actions are repeated: pushing a wall in the Royal Puzzle, spinning the dial in the cell room, rubbing the viewing table. AGAIN rejects an empty history, a fragment and a failed parse, and it restores the saved buffers rather than parsing new input, so the repeated command goes through exactly the same checks. The older parser in this repository has no OOPS at all, and keeps AGAIN as a verb in the verbs file instead."

    content: "The word loop tests each word's parts of speech with WT? and decides what it is. In Zork III the interesting words are the numerals and the quotation marks. A number is not in the dictionary, so the loop calls NUMBER? to turn it into the generic word INTNUM. A quotation mark flips QUOTE-FLAG, and a TELL verb with a quoted tail lets the player address a character: 'dungeon master, follow me'. Speech such as SAY \"FROTZ OZMOO\" is split by the same logic, with the spoken words left in the lexical table for the verb routine to read. Anything the loop does not recognize ends in CANT-USE or UNKNOWN-WORD."

    content: "NUMBER? converts digits to a value, with a limit of 1000 and a special clock-time form with a colon. Zork III is the game that depends on it. The sundial on the parapet takes 1 to 8, and the DIAL routine rejects anything outside that range. The time machine's TM-DIAL takes up to 999, and TM-DIAL-F refuses larger values, matching the three-digit display. The year numbers used in the plot, 776, 777, 883 and 948, are all valid inputs. The parser writes the value to P-NUMBER and gives the verb routine the object INTNUM, which the game's shared globals define for exactly this purpose."

    content: "ORPHAN-MERGE and ORPHAN let the game ask a question and weave the answer into the unfinished command. Zork III's two-object grammar gives it plenty of use: 'tie the rope to', 'give the bread to' and 'put the book in' all need a second object, and the game asks for one when it is missing. The routine takes the answer, checks that it is a noun phrase or a new command, and grafts it onto the saved fragment. A comment marks this routine as the TRAP retrofix of 21 June 1984, a late rewrite."

    content: "When a command lacks an object, GWIM searches the visible scope for the one that has the right attribute and announces its choice in parentheses. Zork III leans on it for many ordinary actions. 'Open' with nothing else finds the one openable thing, and 'read' finds the one readable one. When two things qualify the game asks. The older parser.zil declares a GWIM-DISABLE flag that nothing in that file reads, and the shared parser no longer has it, so the guess is always on. Printing the guess lets the player catch a wrong assumption before it costs a turn."

    content: "GET-OBJECT searches for objects that match the typed words, and its first branch is a Zork III special. If the player typed an adjective but no noun, and the adjective is a direction word, the routine returns the object INTDIR and sets P-DIRECTION to the direction, so a direction can be the object of a verb. INTDIR is defined in 3dungeon under a comment about the old end-game. The same behaviour exists unconditionally in the older parser.zil; the generic file moved it behind a ZORK-NUMBER test so that only Zork III has it. The rest of the routine is the shared search: lit rooms, the player's possessions, ambiguous matches, and 'How about the...?' for ONE."

    content: "LIT? decides whether the player can see, by checking the room's light flag and then the room's contents and the player's possessions for something that is on. Zork III stresses it in an unusual way. Swimming in the lake makes the game drop everything the player holds into the water, and the lamp is swapped for a FRIED-LAMP that will not light. The routine's temporary rewrite of HERE and P-GWIMBIT is how it asks the same question of a room the player is not in."

    wikipedia_url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork_III"
    image_url: ""
    image_caption: ""
    content: "ACCESSIBLE? answers whether the player can touch an object. It is the guard that keeps 'it' from reaching across the map, and in Zork III it also has to cope with rooms that are not rooms. In the Royal Puzzle, objects in the player's cell are stored in a table and moved in and out of the puzzle room as the player slides walls; in the cell dial puzzle, the contents of the eight cells are swapped in the same way. META-LOC walks up the containment tree to the room that holds an object, and the puzzle code moves objects with REMOVE and MOVE so that the tree stays truthful. The accessibility rules are why the trick works at all."
